# sparta-web-testing

There are two files, one that is the introduction file where an introduction to Page Object Model is made, with some examples of methods that could be used. The second file is an exercise where a starter code is given and I had to fill in the methods and tests to make the tests pass.

## Pleased
It was interesting to make UI tests and see it happening in front of me. I am glad that I am able to pick up the syntax quickly.

##Difficulties
There are still a lot of unknowns to me such as what elements can be found and what can't be found. I believe this will come with experience and practice.
