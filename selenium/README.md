# Selenium

Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation. Selenium specifically provides infrastructure for the W3C WebDriver specification â€” a platform and language-neutral coding interface compatible with all major web browsers. For this repository, I used Ruby.

## About the Repository

There is an introduction folder that shows the basics of Selenium and how it is used with OOP. The starter code folder is an exercise that I did to practice using Selenium with a mock application form(see http://toolsqa.com/automation-practice-form/).

## Install

```
gem install selenium-webdriver
```
